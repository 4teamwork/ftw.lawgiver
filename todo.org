  - [ ] implement workflow generator
    - accepts a workflow specification object
    - returns a definition.xml
    - result should be consistent regarding sorting etc, so that it
      can easily be diffed
  - [ ] workflow generator: make sure it breaks when the action of a
    statement is neither an action group nor a transition.
  - [ ] Workflow specification discovery [0/2]
    - [ ] implement a ZCML meta directive (``lawgiver:workflows``)
    - [ ] specification detection in the known workflow directories
  - [ ] user-interface [0/6]
    - [ ] view listing all known specifications
    - [ ] details view: show the specification
    - [ ] details view: show the used permissions mapping
    - [ ] details view: button for writing the definition.xml
    - [ ] details view: button for writing / importing the definition.xml
    - [ ] details view: button for reindexing security for this workflow
